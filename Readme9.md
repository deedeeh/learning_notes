#### Continue Learning Notes - 8

###### Thursday 9th August
+ I worked on the last lab, *__Zhw Shoes__*, in *__CSS Page Layout__* and this is the end of *__Intro to HTML/CSS __* section.
>* The lab had all of the HTML and almost all CSS styles except positioning of wrapper divs.
>* It was required to have 3 columns grid for the content.
>* I had 2 margins between these columns each was `2.25%` and I did subtract the total of the margins from `100%` then divide it by 3.
>* I used `float` & `width` properties a lot and also `clearfix` & `clear` as classes.
>* It was really great to work on that lab I've learned so much about columns and positioning.
>* I still need to practice more on this area cause sometimes it is confusing to work with `float`, `position`, `clearfix` and `clear`.

Check *__hs-zhw-shoes-layout-prework__* repo for my code in *layout.css* file and I added few ids or classes in the *HTML* file such as `deals`, `no-margin-right` and `details_layout`. Also added `clear` and `clearfix` in divs.
