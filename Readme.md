### MY LEARNING NOTES

#### Example

+ Learn more Vanilla JS and document the outcome and share it on Github.
+ Build more projects to build my portfolio and learn through the process.

```JavaScript
function removeTransition(e) {
  if (e.propertyName !== 'transform') return;
  e.target.classList.remove('playing');
}
```

Currently I am doing a Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy by Colt Steele who is a developer and bootcamp instructor.

The course covers Frontend which I have some of its skills and Backend which I know nothing about! It is a good opportunity to learn new technologies that will help me in my career and understand what happens under the hood.

###### Tuesday 6th of March
+ I did an *Image Blog* using HTML and CSS as part of the Bootcamp Intermediate CSS section and next I will be creating a Blog.

Here are few lines of my stylesheet:

```CSS
.title {
  margin-left: 1.66%;
  font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 800;
  font-size: 24px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
  width: 30%;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
```

+ I created a *Blog* using HTML5 and CSS and I really enjoyed building it and it didn't take time.

```HTML
<article>
  <p class="date">November 23 2015</p>
  <h1 class="heading">This is my first article</h1>
  <p class="border-left">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

```

```CSS
.date {

  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: .2em;
}

.heading {
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: 900;
  text-transform: capitalize;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}

.border-left {
  border-left: 6px solid #bdc3c7;
  padding-left: 6px;
}
```

###### Wednesday 7th March
+ Today I am doing the Introduction to JavaScript as a quick reminder to JS because I haven't be coding regularly for some time. I did the primitive data types in addition to 2 simple exercises.

Next is JS Basics: Control Flow.

###### Thursday 8th March
+ Today I went off track by having a basic knowledge about *React* and the reason for that I am going to ReactFest 9 March 2018. I applied for the diversity ticket and I got one! I am excited!
+ A dear friend recommended to check React on the [beta.freecodecamp.org](https://beta.freecodecamp.org) and that is what I am doing today just React.
+ I've learned about JSX and creating React components.

Here are few lines of my code:

```JavaScript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello React!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

###### Friday 9th March
+ Today I went to ReactFest which was awesomeeeeee!!! I am really glad I had the chance to attend this event.
+ I did continue some of the *Web Developer Bootcamp* JavaScript Basics: Control Flow. Here are some of the things I worked on:
>* Comparison operators & type coercion.
>* Logical operators & short circuit evaluation.
>* Truthy & Falsy values.
>* Conditional statements.
