### MY LEARNING NOTES

#### Example

+ Learn more Vanilla JS and document the outcome and share it on Github.
+ Build more projects to build my portfolio and learn through the process.

```JavaScript
function removeTransition(e) {
  if (e.propertyName !== 'transform') return;
  e.target.classList.remove('playing');
}
```

Currently I am doing a Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy by Colt Steele who is a developer and bootcamp instructor.

The course covers Frontend which I have some of its skills and Backend which I know nothing about! It is a good opportunity to learn new technologies that will help me in my career and understand what happens under the hood.
