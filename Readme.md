### MY LEARNING NOTES

#### Example

+ Learn more Vanilla JS and document the outcome and share it on Github.
+ Build more projects to build my portfolio and learn through the process.

```JavaScript
function removeTransition(e) {
  if (e.propertyName !== 'transform') return;
  e.target.classList.remove('playing');
}
```

Currently I am doing a Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy by Colt Steele who is a developer and bootcamp instructor.

The course covers Frontend which I have some of its skills and Backend which I know nothing about! It is a good opportunity to learn new technologies that will help me in my career and understand what happens under the hood.

###### Tuesday 6th of March
I did an Image Blog using HTML and CSS as part of the Bootcamp Intermediate CSS section and next I will be creating a Blog.

Here are few lines of my stylesheet:

```CSS
.title {
  margin-left: 1.66%;
  font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 800;
  font-size: 24px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
  width: 30%;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
```
