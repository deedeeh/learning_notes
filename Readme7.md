#### Continue Learning Notes - 6

######  Thursday 19th July

+ I continued working on *__HTML5__* and today I've learned about:
>* Embedding audio so the tag is `<audio></audio>` and it takes attribute `src` for location.
>>* Different browser render supports different file types and that is why we provide the browser with `<source>` which is just an opening tag.
>>* Its attributes `src` & `type` - for instance `src="audio.mp3"` & `type="audio/mp3"`
>* Embedding video so the tag is `<video></video>` and its attribute `src`
>>* The same idea as `<audio` and the multiple file types so working with `<source` to add multiple files, each file with its own `<source>`.
>>* Its attributes `src` & `type` so example `src="movie.mp4"` & `type="video/mp4"`.
>* There is a converter for videos, audios, etc..., *miro video converter*. It contains different file types.  

######  Monday 23rd July
+ Today I continued the rest of *__Front-End HTML5__* section which contained a code along lab and a lesson full of resources to check.

+ I've learned about semantic containers, google map and practised videos and its different resources such as mp3 & ogv:
>* `<iframe></iframe>` with attributes `src`, `height`, `width` and `style`.
>* `<video></video>` and `source` with its attributes `src` and `type` and in the lab it was `type="video/mp3"` and `type="video/ogg"`
>* `<header></header>` represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
>* `<nav></nav>` tag defines a set of navigation links, only for major block of navigation links.
>* `<section></section>` is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
>>* Examples of sections would be chapters, the tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis.
>>* A Web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, contact information.
>* `<footer></footer>` element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element.
>>* A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.
>>* Footers donâ€™t necessarily have to appear at the end of a section, though they usually do.
>>* When the footer element contains entire sections, they represent appendices, indexes, long colophons, verbose license agreements, and other such content.
>* `<figure></figure>` specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
>>* While the content of the `<figure>` element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow.
>>* If removed it should not affect the flow of the document.
>* `<figcaption></figcaption>` tag defines a caption for a `<figure>` element. It can be placed as the first or last child of the `<figure>` element.
