#### Continue Learning Notes - 6

######  Thursday 19th July

+ I continued working on *__HTML5__* and today I've learned about:
>* Embedding audio so the tag is `<audio></audio>` and it takes attribute `src` for location.
>>* Different browser render supports different file types and that is why we provide the browser with `<source>` which is just an opening tag.
>>* Its attributes `src` & `type` - for instance `src="audio.mp3"` & `type="audio/mp3"`
>* Embedding video so the tag is `<video></video>` and its attribute `src`
>>* The same idea as `<audio` and the multiple file types so working with `<source` to add multiple files, each file with its own `<source>`.
>>* Its attributes `src` & `type` so example `src="movie.mp4"` & `type="video/mp4"`.
>* There is a converter for videos, audios, etc..., *miro video converter*. It contains different file types.
